## Usage

### Running an Optimization

Click the **Optimize Schedule** button on your dashboard card. This will:
1. Run immediate optimization with current settings
2. Save your preferences to the cloud
3. Enable automatic nightly optimization at midnight

### Automatic Nightly Runs

After your first optimization:
- Your custom schedule is automatically recalculated every night
- Uses updated weather forecast, price changes, and your latest preferences

### Monitoring

The integration creates several helpful sensors:
- `sensor.curve_control_...temperature_schedule_chart` - Main schedule data
- `sensor.curve_control_...cost_savings` - Money saved over 120-day period
- `sensor.curve_control_...co2_avoided` - Environmental impact
- `button.curve_control_optimize_schedule` - Manual optimization trigger

---

## Dashboard Card Features

The dashboard card displays:

- **Temperature Schedule Chart** - 24-hour optimized schedule with price bars
- **Electricity Price Colors**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = Off-peak (cheapest)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = Mid-peak
  - ðŸ”´ Red = On-peak (most expensive)
- **Optimize Button** - Run optimization with one click
- **Savings Stats** - Cost savings, percent savings, CO2 avoided

## ðŸ“¡ Data Collection & Privacy

### What Data is Collected?

The integration collects:
- Temperature sensor readings every 5 minutes
- HVAC state (heating/cooling/off)
- Target temperature settings

### Why Collect Data?

**Thermal Learning**: Over time, the system learns:
- How fast your home cools down (cooling rate)
- How fast your home heats up (natural drift rate)
- More accurate predictions = better optimization = more savings

### Your Privacy

- âœ… **Secure Authentication**: All data tied to your account only
- âœ… **No Sharing**: Your data is not shared with third parties

## Tips for Maximum Savings

1. **Set accurate time windows** - Be honest about when you're actually home
2. **Use Medium or High savings level** - Low provides minimal savings
3. **Let it learn** - System gets better after a week of data collection
4. **Check weather integration** - Weather-aware optimization can improve results
5. **Monitor the dashboard** - Watch when AC runs and adjust preferences if needed
